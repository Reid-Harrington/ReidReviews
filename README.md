# ReidReviews
Reid Reviews is a website I created from scratch where I combine my interests in video essays, programming, and creative writing. Built using React, Node.js, and MySQL, this platform lets me explore my love for video game and movie reviews. Even though I've never attempted this type of creative writing before, I saw it as a great way to learn about MySQL databases while expressing my thoughts about my favorite literature and media. Join me on this journey as I share my reviews and develop new skills along the way.
